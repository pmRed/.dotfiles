# Notes for Lenovo X1 Yoga Carbon Arch install
# Forgot initial setup so we are going to skip forward to a working arch boot and nicely set up zsh and termite
# General notes:
# 	- XFE file system
# 	- Inconsolata for Powerline
# 	- termite > urxvt
# 	- don't need a font manager
# 	- oled screen requries alternate beightness settings, check backlight script

# Hybernate on 5% charge, currently testing.
# Follow archwiki laptop link. X1Y does not report battery drop in %.
# did not work, some werid issue occoured on startup.

# compton composite manager
